<h2>Controlling Strategy</h2>
<I>Christopher S. Chapman</I>
<h4>The relationship between management control</br> 
systems and strategy</h4>

<p>The chapters that follow develop our understanding of the relationship<br/>
   between management control systems (MCS) and strategy through the<br/>
   synthesis of a considerable range of work in the fields of strategy and<br/>
   management accounting. As will be seen, such an easy labelling here<br/>
   belies the breadth and complexity of ideas underlying those labels<br/>
   (Miller 1998; Whittington 2003). A part of the motivation for this volume<br/>
   is to demonstrate something of the range of perspectives from which<br/>
   controlling strategy can be seen to be important. This volume does<br/>
   not attempt a complete inventory of possible perspectives, however.<br/>
   Instead, a common thread unites the diverse theoretical syntheses and<br/>
   analyses of field material presented in the contributions that follow.<br/>
   Both individually and collectively the chapters draw out in detail various<br/>
   ways in which MCS may actively build and sustain valuable strategic<br/>
   roles.</p>
       <p>Except in highly controlled and stable environments it has become<br/>
   commonplace to think of MCS as at best irrelevant, more frequently as<br/>
   damaging (Chapman 1997). Yet, there is another view, taken forward in<br/>
   this volume, that MCS can enable innovative strategic responses in<br/>
   contemporary, unstable environments (e.g. Simons 1995; Chapman<br/>
   1998; Ahrens and Chapman 2002, 2004). We hope this book will contrib-<br/>
   uteto the emergence of a clearer and richer discussion of the strategic<br/>
   nature of MCS.</p>
  <p>In the 1950s and 1960s management accounting techniques were seen<br/>
  as effective means of organizational coordination and control. Within<br/>
'  firms and organizations, management accounting played a significant<br/>
 role through the disciplining effects of standard costing, variance analy-<br/>
 sis and related systems (Anthony 1965). The increasing sophistication<br/>
 (aspirations) of corporate planning activities brought budgets greater<br/>
 prominence and prestige as the practical and effective toolkit for imple-<br/>
 menting organizational strategy. Whilst difficulties were clearly acknow-<br/>
 ledged(Argyris 1953; Ridgway 1956), discussions of strategic planning</p>
